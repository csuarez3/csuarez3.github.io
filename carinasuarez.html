	<h3>&ldquo;No Natural Talent&rdquo;: A Sonnet</h3>
		<p>I open Google, hoping for a clue</p>

		<p>"Just write some lines that show a bit of you."</p>
		<p>I hide my fear behind a tranquil mask.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>A sonnet should not be too hard to write.</p>
		<p>I give a gallant try--I try, but fail.</p>
		<p>No talent in my lines, try as I might.</p>
		<p>I go to office hours, to no avail.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>The deadline creeps too close to my blank page.</p>
		<p>My vision blurs with each new line I try.</p>
		<p>Perhaps some metaphor about a cage?</p>

		<p>I hope at least the meter does not stray,</p>
		<p>But even if it does, this ends today!</p>
		<br/>
		<p>The first assignment in my Lyric Poem course was to write a Shakespearean sonnet, which I soon found to be more difficult than I had anticipated.  After many failed attempts at a serious and emotional poem, I decided to write one about one simple truth I know is absolutely certain: I cannot write poetry.  The title &ldquo;No Natural Talent&rdquo; is a quote from my truthful professor's comment about my obvious lack of poetic skills.</p>
		<p>My professor wrote this below my sonnet:</p>
		<blockquote><i>&ldquo;Not much natural talent, maybe, but you're a delight!&rdquo;</i></blockquote>
		<p>That comment will forever be my favorite feedback.</p>

	<p>In Plato’s dialogue <i>Meno</i>, Socrates and the title character Meno search for an answer to the question, &ldquo;What is virtue?&rdquo;  The confusion that results from this conversation prompts Meno to raise an objection in the form of the Paradox of Inquiry.  This essay will give a summary of the Paradox and determine its validity and soundness.  It will also present Socrates’ rebuttal to the Paradox, the Theory of Recollection.  The Theory will be analyzed in terms of whether or not it really gives a solution to the Paradox, taking into account both its strengths and its weaknesses as an argument.</p>
	<h4 id="paradox">Paradox of Inquiry Summary</h4>
	<p>Meno questions Socrates’ process of seemingly unending inquiry that leads to aporia about virtue’s definition.  Meno’s semi-sarcastic query is as follows:</p>
	<blockquote>How will you look for [the answer], Socrates, when you do not know at all what it is?  How will you aim to search for something you do not know at all?  If you should meet with it, how will you know that this is the thing you did not know? (Meno 80d)</blockquote>
	<p>Socrates then states Meno’s questions as an argument, which we now call the Paradox of Inquiry or the debater’s argument:</p>
	<blockquote>[A man] cannot search for what he knows—since he knows it, there is no need to search—nor for what he does not know, for he does know what to look for. (Meno 80e)</blockquote>
	<p>The Paradox presents a serious dilemma.  According to Meno, people start off in either of two ways: knowing what they are looking for or not knowing what they are looking for.  The one who knows does not need to inquire about anything because it would be unnecessary.  The person who does not know cannot look for something because he wouldn’t be able to recognize a correct answer anyway.  Essentially, people cannot learn what they already know nor can they learn what they do not know.  The Paradox written as a formal argument is as follows:</p>
	<blockquote>
	P1: Either S knows x or S does not know x.<br/>
P2: If S knows x, it is impossible to inquire into x.<br/>
<u>P3: If S does not know x, it is impossible to inquire into x.</u><br/>
C: Therefore, whether S knows x or does not know x, it is impossible to inquire into x.
</blockquote>
<h4 id="validity">Validity of Paradox as an Argument</h4>
<p>An argument is valid if its conclusion logically follows its premises.  The actual content of the premises and the conclusion are inconsequential so long as the form is correct in that the conclusion follows the premises.  Neither the premises nor the conclusions need to be true.</p>
<p>As such, the Paradox of Inquiry is valid.  If the only options are that S knows x or S does not know x and in either case it is impossible to inquire into x, it will always be impossible to inquire into x.  Such a logical progression and form is indisputable.</p>
<h4 id="soundness">Soundness of Paradox as an Argument</h4>
<p>An argument is sound if and only if it is valid and all its premises are true.  The Paradox is unsound in multiple ways, the most obvious and simplest being that Premise 3, &ldquo;If S does not know x, it is impossible to inquire into x,&rdquo; is false.  Ross Harman of Oxford University wrote, &ldquo;We might not know the object of our inquiry, but that does not mean that we do not know the methods of inquiry which are necessary to find out this object,&rdquo; (Harman).  He then gives a simple example about a guest who does not know a code-lock but can simply ask for it from an authority figure with a list.  Although the guest does not actually know the code, he knows how to find out what it is through questioning someone else who does.  In this way, he does not the answer, yet he knows how to get to it.  As such, the concept that one would not be able to recognize a correct answer if he does not know it to begin with does not apply in all situations, making that premise false and therefore the overall argument unsound.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;know&rdquo; in the premises also causes several issues in regards to the argument’s soundness.  Meno and Socrates seem to think of knowledge in black and white terms: either you have knowledge or you do not.  I argue that they commit a serious error in thinking in a skewed way: people can and often do have only partial knowledge.  An inquirer who has partial knowledge still needs to inquire and learn more.  He is able to recognize a correct answer but usually cannot get to that answer on his own, thereby refuting all three premises of the Paradox.  Most people do not know everything there is to know about a subject; therefore, most do not have complete knowledge.  A simple example given by Roy Sorensen of <i>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> is as follows: both a young child who cannot spell at all and an adult who specializes in orthography have no use for a spelling dictionary, but the average layman can utilize it effectively.  The child wouldn’t know how to even begin using one, supporting the Paradox’s third premise, and the orthographist has no need of it, supporting the Paradox’s second premise; the average person, however, would use the spelling dictionary because he has enough knowledge of spelling to know the first couple letters of a word but does not know the entire spelling, which shows a flaw in both the second and third premises of the Paradox and therefore makes it unsound. Absolute knowledge is rare, if even existent.</p>
<p>Some people may also claim that they are experts about a subject, but their knowledge of that subject is actually just opinion.  A simple example of this exists in regards to religion.  There are hundreds of different religions in the world, and in each there is at least one person who thinks that his religion is the true and right one, which cannot be true in every case due to the sheer amount of &lsquo;right&rsquo; religions that would exist.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Paradox's Solution/Non-Solution</h4>
<p>Socrates clearly does not agree with the Paradox of Inquiry, but he does not resolve Meno’s question with a firm answer either.  Socrates aims to solve the Paradox with his Theory of Recollection, which states that the immortal soul knows everything there is to learn, and therefore  &lsquo;learning&rsquo;  is simply a process of remembering that which a person forgot at birth: &ldquo;searching and learning are, as a whole, recollection,&rdquo; (Meno 81d).  Socrates attempts to prove his Theory through his questioning of Meno’s slave boy, who according to Socrates had prior true opinions that led to knowledge without anyone actually teaching him, a concept I will critique in the next section.  The fact that the Theory simply dismisses learning in favor of recollection means that it does not actually answer the Paradox; rather, it confuses and tricks Meno, leaving him in the classic Socratic state of aporia.</p>
<h4 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses of Socrates' Theory of Recollection</h4>
<p>The Paradox of Inquiry relates to both empirical and non-empirical questioning, yet Socrates’ Theory of Recollection does not hold up in regards to empirical knowledge.  Plato did not think highly of empirical observation, which is evident in the Theory’s implications about knowledge.  Socrates’ assumption that the soul is immortal and thus knows everything may work when speaking about morals or virtue, but even an immortal soul has no way of truly knowing who is knocking at the door or what kinds of flowers are on South Quad.  Those require observation in the moment as they are changeable and thus they are not subject to the soul’s seemingly infinite knowledge.  Empirical data must be observed or concluded at the end of an experiment, but the Theory does not even hint at what sort of process enables the soul to know such data before it even exists.  Even though Plato did not approve of empiricism as true knowledge, it is still a type of knowledge and therefore cannot be disregarded.</p>
<p>Socrates’ example of the slave boy &lsquo;recalling&rsquo; mathematical concepts has a major flaw: leading questions.  Although Socrates says he acted more as a guide than a teacher, there were several instances in which it was evident that Socrates was teaching the boy considering that many of the questions took the form of, &ldquo;You know such and such to be true, right?&rdquo;  The boy would of course affirm this.  The suggestive language that Socrates uses is especially evident in 85a: &ldquo;Does not this line from one corner to the other cut each of these figures in two?&rdquo;  This is not a question that the slave boy can answer by opinion or &lsquo;prior knowledge&rsquo;; in fact, it is barely a question and more of a statement.  That was not merely guidance on the part of Socrates: it was blatant manipulation and teaching, as was most of the example.</p>
<p>Even the paths of opinions or &ldquo;prior knowledge&rdquo; are questionable.  We may all come to the same knowledge eventually if it is inborn as Socrates suggests, but we also all start out with different opinions.  As such, our opinions can take us in completely polar directions of thought.  Socrates never addresses in what manner we all would manage to attain the same final knowledge.  This flaw in his argument is even more pronounced when taking into account that some people rely on false opinions.  The idea of a false path and answer is highlighted when the slave boy comes to the wrong answer first and then to the right one with Socrates’ questions.  We do not automatically know what opinions are true and what opinions are false, as I previously wrote about in regards to different religions, so how are we supposed to know which paths to knowledge are true?  Teachers are certainly useful, if not necessary, to guide us along the right path.</p>
<h4 id="strengths">Strengths of Socrates' Theory of Recollection</h4>
<p>Not all knowledge seems to be innate as Socrates advocates, but some knowledge may very well be.  This is evidenced by their universality and lack of cultural influence.  &lsquo;A priori truths&rsquo; may form the basis for the Theory’s main strength.  Basic mathematical principles are such truths, which is why Socrates’ questioned the slave boy about geometry.  Plato, however, is not keen on the scientific method, and it is not applicable to his questions about ideas such as virtue and justice.  Morals may be natural, but they also seem to change from culture to culture and some people are born seemingly without them (for example, H. H. Holmes, the serial killer).  As such, they would not be part of the category of unchangeable truths that Socrates assigns as knowledge.  In any case, there is knowledge that may be inborn, supporting the Theory.</p>
<p>A more solid example of knowledge being possibly inborn is presented by Noam 
Chomsky, the linguist and philosopher, in regards to language: &ldquo;[a speaker has the] ability to produce new sentences, sentences that are immediately understood by other speakers although they bear no […] resemblance to sentences which are &lsquo;familiar,&rsquo; &rdquo; (Jones).  The acquisition of language relates to Socrates’ Theory about prior knowledge in that the ability to form sentences is innate, which means that it would already be learned by the soul according to Socrates. Even young children who are not formally taught a language can still form unique sentences.  Little Susie may never have heard anyone else say, &ldquo;The yellow snake just bit me,&rdquo; but she can definitely put that sentence together if the need arises. Living around people who speak causes innate linguistic knowledge to be &ldquo;stirred up like a dream&rdquo; (Meno 85c).  As such, Socrates and Chomsky would agree that we know much more than what we have formally learned.</p>
<p>The soul’s knowledge tends apply better to non-empirical questions, for which there may not be an organized way to get answers.  This works out well for Socrates considering that most of his questions are non-empirical: what is justice, what is virtue, etc.  As such, people may come to answers for non-empirical questions simply because they already had the answers within them.  More often than not, we discover those answers through reasoned enlightenment, &ldquo;The Aha!&rdquo; orm &ldquo;erlebnis,&rdquo; meaning the experience of sudden realization, rather than being taught (Cohen).  We have an innate ability to reason, that is to utilize logic in order to figure out the significance of what we believe, which favors Socrates’ Theory of Recollection because reasoning is the ultimate tool of knowledge.  It is possible that all knowledge is obtained through inherent means.  At the very least, the ability to reason and attain knowledge is inborn, not learned.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest strength in Socrates’ Theory is the moral aspect of it: &ldquo;I would contend […] that we will be better men, braver and less idle, if we believe that one must search for the things one does not know&rdquo; (Meno 86b).  Although the Theory may have its downfalls, it is evident that someone who never searches for more will have no greatness in this life.  The searching and questioning that Socrates regards so highly is an innate characteristic of humans and that is what really disputes the Paradox of Inquiry: people will always inquire.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Socrates’ Theory of Recollection raises some interesting points, but it does not directly address Meno’s Paradox of Inquiry.  The Theory is a nice concept because it enforces a constant search for knowledge; however, it is not applicable in every situation, so it cannot be a universal truth, the only form of true knowledge.</p>

<article id="capitalpunishment">
	<h3>Deontology and Rehabilitation vs. Capital Punishment</h3>
<p>In this essay, I will argue against capital punishment on philosophical, moral, and practical grounds. Although proponents of the death penalty cite retribution and the overall safety of society as reasons to uphold the death penalty, true justice is more than just the result of an action, an important premise of Deontology. Justice has to consider the &lsquo;means&rsquo; to the end. If the means are not part of a moral norm, the end is not justifiable. The death penalty&rsquo;s reflection upon society also evidences its negative nature due to what it shows about humanity.</p>
<p>Deontology provides a strong base for the argument against capital punishment because it proposes universal standards of morality (the &ldquo;Right&rdquo;) rather than situational morals based on outcomes (the &ldquo;Good&rdquo;). The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states:</p>
<blockquote>For such deontologists, what makes a choice right is its conformity with a moral norm. Such norms are to be simply obeyed by each moral agent […] In this sense, […] the Right is said to have priority over the Good. If an act is not in accord with the Right, it may not be undertaken, no matter the Good that it might produce. (Alexander)</blockquote>
<p>The foil of deontology is consequentialism, which holds that the morality of choices is <i>determined by their consequences</i>, which is the &ldquo;Good&rdquo; mentioned in the above quote; in other words, the &ldquo;Good&rdquo; refers to &lsquo;good&rsquo; outcomes. Deontology holds that the &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; which are universal moral norms, is superior to the &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;  Killing people or taking lives cannot be considered a &ldquo;moral norm&rdquo; because society as a whole does not condone such an action in an ordinary setting. Every person is considered a &ldquo;moral agent,&rdquo; from a layperson to a judge to an executioner. Those are both self-evident truths. As such, the death penalty violates the Right in favor of the Good, which proponents of capital punishment typically argue is the protection of society in general. People do not become inhuman after committing a crime, and every human life has value. As I previously stated, the convention of taking a life is by no means a &ldquo;moral norm,&rdquo; so respecting a human&rsquo;s right to life must apply to people on death row too. Killing is never morally permissible, whether the killing is state-sponsored or not.</p>
<p>The death penalty places the government as a superior &ldquo;moral agent.&rdquo;  Some may argue that the government is naturally higher than the citizen. The government, however, is made up of individuals, and each is a moral agent no more extraordinary than any other. The groups of individuals that enforce the supposed Good instead of the Right no longer abide by humanity&rsquo;s moral norms. Picking and choosing who lives and who dies does not concede to the Right. It forces some people (legal entities) into <i>superhuman</i> positions and others (criminals) into <i>subhuman</i> positions when in reality <i>all people are simply human</i>. Why do we continue to allow these unnatural divisions? Answers to that question tend to be unclear and unsatisfactory, so I propose a clear answer in favor of the Right: we should not.</p>
<p>The death penalty is often compared to killing someone in self-defense. The desperation of a moment in which one cannot flee, however, is not analogous to the premeditated and long legal process of capital punishment. An inmate under high security does not pose a threat, so killing him is not a defensive action. Also, incapacitating an attacker is typically as effective as killing him even in cases of self-defense. If one has the opportunity to shoot a man in self-defense, he has the option to shoot a non-vital part of him—perhaps the foot or leg—that will greatly hinder but not kill him, which will effectively keep oneself safe. In this analogy, life imprisonment is the shot to the foot that will keep society safe, both morally and physically.</p>
<p>Deontology also states that &ldquo;all human actions must originate with some kind of mental state&rdquo; (Alexander). As such, what mindset does the current system of imprisonment perpetuate? I have already stated that capital punishment creates god-like legal entities, but this superhuman mindset translates much further than the courtroom or jail cell. The American justice system has changed dramatically and for the worse. In the words of Dr. Entienne Benson&rsquo;s cover story for the American Psychological Association&rsquo;s publication <i>Monitor on Psychology</i>:</p>
<blockquote>Until the mid-1970s, rehabilitation was a key part of U.S. prison policy. Prisoners were encouraged to develop occupational skills and [mandated] to resolve psychological problems—such as substance abuse or aggression—that might interfere with their reintegration into society… Since then, however, rehabilitation has taken a back seat to a &ldquo;get tough on crime&rdquo; approach that sees punishment as prison&rsquo;s main function… The approach has created explosive growth in the prison population, while having at most a modest effect on crime rates. (Benson)</blockquote>
<p>By continuing to implement the death penalty, we create a culture of punishment rather than that of rehabilitation. This does not better recidivism rates, the percentage of inmates who return to prison after being released. In fact, prisons in states like New Hampshire that stress rehabilitation tend to have lower recidivism rates (New Hampshire). This is the crux of the argument: the death penalty and punishment mindset stemming from it do not allow for possible growth.</p>
<p>People have the capacity to change and grow. Subjecting the nation to the use of capital punishment means that we as a nation do not believe in human potential, which shows a rather disheartening indifference. Every person on death row is human; there are no situations in which a person in power can say with 100% confidence that a convict is incapable of change. Rehabilitation may be impossible only in the cases of mental disorders, and even then society tends to agree that allowances must be made because of the nature of the issue.</p>
<p>So then why are some people allowed their lives while others who have committed the same crime put to death? Although the capital punishment system is not arbitrary, it is also not entirely fair. Proponents may then advocate doling out the death penalty more, but where is the humanity in that? Isn&rsquo;t rehabilitation better and more moral than killing? Capital punishment is much more expensive than life imprisonment: in 2008, a report by the Urban Institute Justice Policy Centers showed that death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases in Maryland (Roman). Other states such as Kansas show similar or even greater costs. I propose that states make rehabilitation a priority, putting the exorbitant amount of money wasted on capital punishment to better use that will hurt fewer people and allow for lower recidivism rates.</p>
<p>Some proponents of the death penalty may argue that executing a criminal allows his victim&rsquo;s family to gain closure and peace. The next question I&rsquo;ll ask, however, relates to family and peace in much the same way: what of the criminal&rsquo;s family? They have not committed a crime, yet they must face the pain of losing a loved one. In National Geographic&rsquo;s documentary Inside Death Row Texas, a family member of a convict states, &ldquo;Sometimes I am worried it is in our blood.&rdquo;  A family member does not see an inmate being put to death; she sees her brother, her father, or her cousin on the table with a needle in his arm. Yes, the original victim&rsquo;s family suffered much pain, but does our nation really lack the empathy for the prisoner&rsquo;s loved ones? Does the Good of eliminating a low-potential risk outweigh the Right of valuing human life?</p>
<p>I have argued through deontologists&rsquo; terms that capital punishment severely infringes upon the Right and moral norm of killing people by elevating some moral agents in the government to positions of god or superhuman. All moral agents, whether they are students writing a Philosophy paper or judges holding court over a double homicide, should be held to the same standards. Furthermore, the ends do not justify the means, especially when the ends simply perpetuate a cycle of pain caused by death. No family should have to go through the death of a loved one, and no family will gain peace through the death of an enemy. Our society must stop maintaining this hate cycle and instead focus on rehabilitating criminals as there is no way to undeniably know a person is incapable of change.</p>

	<h3>Plato’s <i>Phaedrus</i> and Lost &ldquo;Love&rdquo;</h3>
	<p>Although Socrates speaks of love as a negative madness in his first speech, the alternative—losing love—seems far worse.  The man makes great efforts and promises to the boy in order to keep a relationship that, according to Socrates’ first speech, should not have even occurred.  The relationship itself was never selfless or good due to the fact that it was founded on the ideas and expectations of what the lover could accomplish and receive; instead, a good relationship is defined as the mutual bettering of the couple’s souls.  Socrates sums the scenario up perfectly with just six words: &ldquo;But now it’s time to pay!&rdquo;  The madness of love that had previously imbued the man is replaced by sanity once again, at which point he reverts back to a sensible person: &ldquo;Another set of rulers and controllers have ousted the old ones in him: sense and sanity have taken the place of madness and love.&rdquo;  After this switch back to sanity, the man leaves the boy behind in the dust.  The former lover is not the one who has to pay the most, however; the boy is the victim in this scenario as had been duped and manipulated into loving the man.  He is still wrapped in the insanity of love, pleading for the return of the love which man no longer holds and reminding the man of his previous promises and efforts.  This creates great humiliation and disgrace in the man for he recognizes the insanity of his previous actions and refuses to revert to them again.  It seems as if his only possible alternative is running away, which he does.  Once again, the boy is the one who is hurt.  In Socrates’ first speech, succumbing to love is little more than begging to be hurt, yet we never realize it even after the pain of loss hits us, as evidenced by the boy still trailing the man.</p>
	<p>Why is love bound to hurt?  A lover is &ldquo;a man necessarily out of his mind.&rdquo;  He lives only for his own aims.  The worst part is that the man—the lover—makes the boy into a lover just like him and equally as insane.  This creates a cycle in which the boy then &ldquo;is forced to follow with indignant cries to heaven,&rdquo; essentially causing him to act in a similar way as the former lover did with his pleas and promises.  As for your question, &ldquo;Are you sure that the boy necessarily becomes a lover?  He may just think that someone should keep the promises he made,&rdquo; the boy may not necessarily become a lover, but he does seem to be in a similar position as the lover was before he got what he wanted.  This is highlighted in the sentence, &ldquo;The shoe’s on the other foot; the roles are changed…&rdquo;  Now it is the boy who is trying to bring the lover back into the relationship as the lover had once done with him.  &ldquo;…the boy whom, with many promises and vows and prayers, [the man] had only by great effort constrained to endure a relationship,&rdquo; becomes the one who tries to keep the relationship going or even start it anew again.  Although the boy may just be angry about the broken promises and lack of someone to take care of him, I think that the boy did fall in love, thus making him into a man alike to his former lover.</p>
	<p>This paragraph sets up the worst scenario of love, closely following a passage about &ldquo;adhesive enslavement.&rdquo;  It shows that love may start off as a one-way relationship, but the requited love turned stale that is bound to follow is significantly worse: it basically produces more lovers, more madmen.  This begs the question of whether or not Plato thinks love is eternal, but I think that this first speech is more geared towards physical, erotic love rather than true love that can advance the couple’s souls instead of harming them.</p>

	<h3>Plato’s <i>Republic</i> and the Tripartite Soul and Desires</h3>
	<p>Plato’s concept of political justice is based mainly on structure, and from that structure he draws an analogy for individual justice.  According to him, three main castes make up the just city: the producers, the auxiliaries, and the guardians.  In order for the city to remain just, the relationships between the castes must be fixed in that they cannot intermingle.  Each individual in each group must adhere to a certain, single profession to which the person has a predisposition so as to obtain mastery of the trade.  As such, each class has its own position of power and influence in the society compared to the other classes, yet no one class is considered superior to another in that there are no stigmas to being a producer rather than a guardian, for example.</p>
	<p>He furthers this caste system by making it part of the citizens’ blood through the  Myth of the Metals, a noble lie which serves the purpose to highlight that the three divisions are seen in people.  The guardians’ blood is mixed with gold, the auxiliaries’ with silver, and the producers’ with bronze or iron.  There is no combination of blood metals nor is there stigma to the metal.  In fact, a person may not rise through the ranks of metals throughout his lifetime, but he may be born to Bronze parents yet belong to the Silver class.  As such, the Myth of the Metals allows that a person’s character determines his status rather than working at a profession that does not befit him.  The premise of the just city is the capacity of certain people for certain types of work. </p>
	<p>In Book IV, Plato outlines the argument that each individual’s soul contains equivalents to the three classes of the just city’s society.  His whole purpose for the just city is to set up the Big Letter Little Letter framework—examining something small by first analyzing an analogous but larger entity—so as to more easily tackle the issue of the soul.  According to him, the soul is just like the city in that they are both tripartite entities in which each part of the soul or city is fixed in a relationship with the others in regards to power and influence.  Plato’s biggest task is arguably showing that there really are three parts of the soul—every individual has a tripartite soul—and then showing that each part is analogous to a caste in the just city.  In other words, he attempts to establish that there are three distinct sets of desires in every individual and that each source of desire refers to a distinct part of the soul.</p>
<p>By showing that each individual has three distinct sets of desires, Plato makes the transition from the city to the individual by showing that group properties stem from individual properties.  Each person’s caste, or the group properties, is determined by his individual properties.  The fact that each source of desire is independent of the others allows that all three can be utilized concurrently.  The harmony of the political structure of the just city is formed only because of the independence and the resulting harmony of the castes due to their fixed stations as there is no need for conflict between castes.  Just so, the three sources and sets of desires in the individual work together to form an individual’s characteristic but do not clash with each other.</p>
<p>An important premise of the three sets of desires is found on 436c: &ldquo;It’s plain that the same thing won’t be willing at the same time to do or suffer opposites with respect to the same part and in relation to the same thing.&rdquo;  In other words, one thing cannot be affected in two opposite ways at the same time.  Plato clears up this potentially confusing concept by giving the examples of &ldquo;acceptance to refusal, longing to take something to rejecting it, embracing to thrusting away,&rdquo; pairs of situations that cannot occur simultaneously (437b).  This furthers the separation between each of the three sources of desires.  One source of desire cannot have polar interests, but the three different sources of desires may be in conflict.</p>
<p>Plato identifies the three sources of desires: the appetitive part that desires everything else, especially money but also including food, drink, and sex; the rational part that desires truth; and the spirited part that desires honor.  Each desire correlates with a part of the tripartite soul.  Plato makes the connection between desire and soul by saying that every desire comes about due to something else that desires: a part of the soul needs to desire something in order for there to be desire.  That part of the soul becomes an agent of desire.  He writes about the appetitive part of the soul mainly through an analogy about thirst, which is a desire: &ldquo;…thirsting itself will never be a desire for anything other than that of which it naturally is a desire—for drink alone…&rdquo; (437e). Plato uses thirst to represent all purely appetitive desires.  Thirst is a desire for drink in general, not a particular kind of drink, which forms the distinction between appetitive and rational desires due to the fact that thirst is spurred by pure natural needs without rational conditions or discriminations. </p>
<p>The conflict between different sources of desires is addressed in the form of appetitive versus rational: &ldquo;Since it was related to a particular kind of thing, didn’t it too become a particular kind of thing itself?&rdquo; (438d).  Continuing with the thirst example, Plato claims that some thirsty people do not want to drink, perhaps because the drink is unhealthy.  The desire for general drink is buffered by the rationale of health.  As such, there is an agent who wants to drink and another one which doesn’t, meaning that there are different agents of desire and, in a larger sense, different parts of the soul.  The agent that wants to drink is the appetitive part and the one that does not is the rational part.</p>
<p>The third part of the soul is the source and agent of spirited desire.  It is not appetitive because a man can be angry at his appetite, which is shown through a rather bizarre example about desiring to look at corpses while struggling not to do so (440a).  Anger and indignation are types of desires stemming from the overall class of spirited desire.  Plato links spirit and reason more so than he does reason with appetite or spirit with appetite; spirit carries out the desires of reason yet it can sometimes act without reason.  In 441b, Plato writes, &ldquo;…even in little children, one could see that they are full of spirit straight from birth, while, as for calculation, some seem to me never to get a share of it, and the many do so quite late.&rdquo;  While these lines sound quite flippant, they do serve well as an example of spirit without reason: children do not tend to reason yet they are certainly full of spirited desires, evidenced best by temper tantrums.</p>
<p>The three distinct parts of desire come together as active forces that motivate movement in a passive body.  As such, the soul is the basis of human activity because it is the collection of active principles and forces.  Even though each active force can exert itself in opposition to another, all three work together to drive activity.  Much as the Gold, the Silver, and the Bronze come together to form and animate the just city, the three desires and subsequent three parts of the soul comes together to animate the human body.</p>
